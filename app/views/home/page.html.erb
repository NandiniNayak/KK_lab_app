					<p>We are interested in developing and applying new technologies in the
					 fields of mass spectrometry and proteomics. The impressive amount of data
					 generated by the genomics revolution is being organized and made accessible
				 	 in a variety of databases and libraries. These include genomic and expressed
				   sequence tag databases, transcriptome maps, and protein databases that describe
					 the identity of some of the proteins expressed by a tissue or cell, as well as
					 other relevant properties including their structure, function and macromolecular
					 interactions. Many of these databases describe the situation encountered at the
					 time of the measurements in a static manner. However, many biological processes
					 are dynamic responses to extraneous perturbations, be they environmental,
					 pharmacological, pathological, genetic or otherwise. The ability to detect
					 accurately and to quantify all of the changes included by a specific perturbation
					 is therefore an essential part of the study of dynamic biological processes.
					 At the heart of all aspects of our lab is protein sequencing by mass spectrometry.
					 Simplified greatly, a tandem mass spectrometer can "sequence" a peptide ion by
					 first measuring the mass of the peptide and then selectively isolating and gently
					 fragmenting that peptide at peptide bonds followed by mass measurement of the fragment
					  ions. The resulting tandem mass spectrum contains the sequence information for a
						single peptide. The astounding power of the technique can be understood when one
						compares traditional peptide sequencing by Edman degradation with peptide sequencing
						by mass spectrometry. A decapeptide can be sequenced by Edman degradation in about
						12 hours. That same peptide can be sequence by a tandem mass spectrometer in about
						1 second at 10 to 100 times the sensitivity.
